# 🟩 🟩 🟩 Contribution Pixel Painter 🎨🖌️🖼️

#### Turn your GitHub contribution graph into a canvas where you can 'paint' commits on specific days.

> Let's abuse the GitHub contribution graph!

## What is this?

If you were going to come up with a way to stress someone out about how much they are contributing, heavily featuring a big graph of all their contributions over time would be a great way to do so!

This is my contributions graph right now, and I'm unsatisfied:

**Don't be dominated by a simple calendar - chill out, mate!**

### How does this work?

Git allows you to manually select the day you want to make a commit at.

Why? What purpose is there for this? - I can't come up with one either that isn't shenanigans like these.

Therefore, if we carefully make commits on certain dates, we can draw just about whatever we want on our contribution graphs!

Though many other people have made similar things in the past, I feel that this project will make it easier & simpler to add whatever you want in a less restrictive way.

Let's get started...

## Usage

1. Copy the `contribution-pixel-painter.py` into the repo you want the commits to be attributed to.
2. Make sure you have tkinter installed.
	- Mac: `brew install python-tk@3.12`
	- Windows: `py -m pip install tk`
	- Linux 💪: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` (debian / ubuntu)
3. Run the program - `python3 contribution-pixel-painter.py` & Input the year you want the pixel art to appear in.

4. A window will open - Draw out what you want to see in your contribution graph.

> [!NOTE]
> You can switch colors to different shades of green. If other commits already exist in that year, this may not look quite as expected. \
> The program will simply create 2 commits for the medium shade and 4 commits for the brightest shade.

5. Close the window.

6. Push the changes to GitHub!
