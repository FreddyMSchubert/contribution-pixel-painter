# 🟩🟩🟩 Contribution Pixel Painter 🎨🖌️🖼️

> Let's abuse the GitHub contribution graph!

## Usage

1. Copy the `contribution-pixel-painter.py` into the repo you want the commits to be attributed to.
2. Make sure you have tkinter installed - `brew install python-tk@3.12`.
3. Run the program - `python3 contribution-pixel-painter.py` & Input the year you want the pixel art to appear in.

4. A window will open - Draw out what you want to see in your contribution graph.

> [!NOTE]
> You can switch colors to different shades of green. If other commits already exist in that year, this may not look quite as expected. \
> The program will simply create 2 commits for the medium shade and 4 commits for the brightest shade.

5. Close the window.

6. Push the changes to GitHub!
